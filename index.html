- Nice work!

- Corner cases, e.g., handling a list of length 1

- Slicing rather than calling a string method

- Short circuiting for or/and

  # Project 2 Requirements

- Make sure to adhere to required design 

- Use a [docstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for every function

- Use type hints in all cases

- Pay attention to variable names

- Cite use of concepts we haven't discussed

- Multiple substantive commits with meaningful messages

*Deductions may be taken for neglecting to do any of the above.*

---

# Project 2 - Other Design Elements

- Functions perform one task

- Repeated code is converted into a function or loop

- Use constants where appropriate

---

# Style Considerations

- Review [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

From the guide:

- Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

- Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

- Avoid extraneous whitespace 

- Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.), comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <>, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not).

- Compound statements (multiple statements on the same line) are generally
discouraged

- Naming conventions

# Project Questions?

# Recursion

- A *recursive* function is a function defined in terms of itself.

# Factorial

- n! is n * (n-1)!

- Let's implement this iteratively...then without using a loop!

---

# Why recursion?

- Some problems are more easily solved recursively.
  * Traversal of a tree structure...like your file system!

# Why not recursion?

- Recursion can be highly inefficient as resources are allocated for each function call.

---

# Rules of Recursion

1. You must have a base case

2. Each recursive call must make progress toward the base cases

3. Assume recursive calls work

---

```python
if(base case)
	solve
else
	do task
	recursive call
```

```python
if(base case)
	solve
else
	recursive call
	do task
```
